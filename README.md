# Campus-Navigation-System
A Java-based campus navigation system built as a semester project. It models buildings as graph nodes and paths as edges, using an adjacency matrix and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to compute shortest routes. Focused on applying core concepts like graphs, algorithms, and OOP to solve real-world navigation problems.
